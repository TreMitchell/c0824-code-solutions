## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  - My answer: No, with two reasons. The first one is that AI is just barely starting out. Even though its good, it isn't good enough to what it can become and therefore, some software jobs can still be used as developer-built rather than AI-built. My second reason is that there needs to be someone making this AI. Unless hardcoded, AO can't make their own AI.
  - AI answer: AI tools are becoming increasingly capable in software development, but they’re unlikely to replace software developers entirely. AI can automate certain tasks, like generating code snippets, testing, or even refactoring, which can help developers work more efficiently. However, software development involves complex problem-solving, creativity, and understanding user needs—areas where human developers excel.
- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  - My answer: The best way t use AI tools when learning software development is when you are confused on how something works & you can't get a fast response in time.
  - AI answer: AI tools can be very helpful in the learning process. Some ways to use them effectively are practice and feedback, code examples and explanations, problem-solving assistance. project help, etc... .
- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  - My answer: The danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning is that you can become too reliant on AI to the point of doing all of your work while I am not understanding how the AI made that conclusion of code.
  - AI answer: There are many dangers of using AI tools while you're still learning. One of these dangers is over-Reliance. Relying too heavily on AI tools might prevent you from fully understanding the underlying concepts and logic. Another danger is the lack of problem-solving Skills If you use AI tools to solve problems without trying to solve them yourself first, you might miss out on developing critical problem-solving skills. Another one is you're learning curve: Using AI tools without a solid understanding of the basics might slow down your learning process, as you may depend on tools rather than grasping core principles.
