## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  - A function is a block of reusable code that performs a task.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  - The function keyword creates a new function. You then create a name for the function followed by a list of zero or more parameters that are separated by a comma and surrounded by parentheses then finished with the opening and closing curly braces. Lastly, a return statement will be required in order to return the function properly.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  - (1)Create a new function and assign it to the defined function and (2) a return value to a variable. Then (3)log the new variable into the console. The process repeats if you want to call your recently made function.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  - The function definition describes what to do, while the function call actually performs the action based on the definition.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  - A parameter is a placeholder to an unknown value while an argument is the actual value that is passed to the function when called.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  - Function parameters are useful because parameters enhance the flexibility, reusability, and functionality of functions
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  - The two effects that a return statement have on the behavior of a function is the returning value and the function's execution.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  - => is the syntax for defining an arrow function.
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  - There is not return keyword required and instead will automatically return the value and an arrow function would need to be a single expression.
